# SEP10 Freedom Project
by **Anna Maria Deleva**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing.

For my project, I chose the topic of **Movie Production**. 

I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study **Aframe** in order to help me make my website.

## Implications
##### PROS
* This website makes it easier for beginners to learn movie production by showing them simple tools like CapCut and pCam Pro.

* A-Frame helps producers save time and money since they can plan out their scenes before they even start filming.

* It also gives users a chance to be creative with things like 3D printing and interactive movies where the audience can help shape the story.

* Everything you need is in one spot, so you don’t have to waste time looking all over the internet for the right apps or gear.

* The website shows what movie-making might look like in the future, with ideas like smellable films and custom endings.
##### CONS
* Some of the advanced tools are hard to use if you don’t already know a lot about editing or filming.

* A few of the tools and equipment, like drones and smart lenses, can cost a lot and might not be realistic for students or small creators.
