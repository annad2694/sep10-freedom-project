# Entry 1: What is the future of Movie Production?
##### 10/14/24

## Deciding what Topic

When Mr. Mueller provided a long list of possibilities of topics that we could use for our freedom project, I was overwhelmed but nonetheless surprised. I had not envisioned so many possibilities in my brain for how endless the number of topics my project could be about. I searched through the list and chose three that I liked. Those topics were cosmetics, marketing, and media production. However, when I started researching, I realized that I was only curious about one of these topics. Ever since I was young, I was always fascinated with the technological concepts and devices that produced movies. I am a big movie fanatic, and my Freedom Project being about the big mystery of how movies are made was the perfect match. Websites on the internet like ["How Technology is Revolutionising Film Production"](https://www.sae.edu/gbr/insights/how-technology-is-revolutionising-film-production/#:~:text=Digital%20technology%20has%20not%20only,of%20traditional%20cinemas%20or%20multiplexes.) by SAE provide information on how technology plays a part in film production, but also this website ["The Future of Filmmaking"](https://raindance.org/the-future-of-filmmaking-5-filmmaking-trends-to-watch-out-for-in-2024/) is something I also want to look into because it includes possible trends that can appear in the future that can advance the technology used in filming, such as movies in theaters incorporating all five senses. Seeing the different ways new technology is integrated into movie production was captivating and further ignited my passion for everything behind the scenes. 

## Engineering Design Process

As of late, I am still on the first step of the engineering design process, defining, which has taken me a while to figure out. I have officially decided to stick with movie production because it falls in- line with my line of passions. When I grow up, I wish to be something in film, but something that also involves technology, and I predict that the filmmaker falls in line with that pretty smoothly. The second step is to research all about movie production, which might take a while since I'll have to read a lot of articles, watch videos, and even engage with people in that line of work to get a better understanding of the profession and how the modern world of technology and code can play a part in that field. 

## Skills

+ *Priotiziation*
+ *How to Google*
+ *Time Management*

#### Prioritization: I realize what a big opportunity this entire class is to me and that the work in this class helps me better myself with useful knowledge and experience, so any assignment or project from this class will be put at the top of my list for completion and will be worked on with excellence. So I have learned from this blog so far that it should be completed and the research I am searching for will be found for my topic so I can continue with the Freedom Project every Monday. 

#### How to Google: I say this as a skill because it is very important to know how to find what you are looking for specifically out of all the websites and/or documents listed on the Google page. Some articles will be irrelevant, and some will have very useful information deep inside the pages of the website, and it is a hard job to find those and be able to list them. Since beginning the blog, I have learned what keywords, such as technology and innovation, to search and extensions to help me better find a certain place within Internet pages of Google and websites to exactly pinpoint the research I need for my project. 

####Time Management: 
This is one of the key factors of participating in this schedule of every Monday to continue our project and the rest of the week to research. To prioritize, I need to also manage my time. After school, I am either cooped up at home doing all of my other assignments or going out on random adventures with my friends. If I want to dedicate myself to these projects and learn code, I will have to cut the time short with my adventures and focus on what's really at hand. I have chosen not to participate in any clubs this year since I want to have time to study for important tests this year and have time to make sure all of my assignments, like this blog, are well completed, so I can take a proper next step into finishing the Freedom Project. 

## Next steps

I am excited to learn more about movie production and how technology can further adapt our experience when we entertain ourselves with movies in the future.
