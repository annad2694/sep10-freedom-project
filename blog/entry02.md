# Entry 2: What is the future of Movie Production?
##### 10/14/24

## Context
Since writing Blog 1, my focus has been on searching the web for software and hardware related to movie production. I wanted to look for more ways one could participate in the movie industry. Whether that be digitally or physically. The information I found researching software or apps that I could use to further indulge myself in knowledge or the actual production of quick films or edits. I looked for efficient and cheap ones that anyone could use to create their own short film. I needed software that works on Apple iOS devices, is easy to use on the go, and doesn't need to be set up somewhere. It had to have built-in transitions and sound contingencies to add sound effects and/or manipulate the voices of the actors staring in it. I found an app called WeVideo that satisfies all of these perks. I found WeVideo through changing my strategy for searching for something on the internet. Instead of imputing in the search bar "movie production" from last week, I have changed it to movie production apps" and have looked further into a website that ranked the weaknesses and strengths of movie production apps that are not commonly used. It described to me that it had tutorials in case anyone was confused about how to use it, and when I tried it myself, it was easy to understand and was great software. For my findings on hardware, I have found another article explaining inventions that changed the course of entertainment history. In this website called <a href="https://www.wrapbook.com/blog/new-film-technology">"10 Film Technologies Disrupting the Entertainment Industry" by Loring Weisenberger</a>, he talked about 3D printing, and in another called <a href="https://www.desktop-documentaries.com/video-production-equipment.html"> "Video Production Equipment" by Desktop Documentaries" </a> it talks about aerial landscape drones with high mic sensitivity, but I found one in particular that interested me. A new invention called "Moon Smart Focus." This device has incredible focus and can zoom into the tiniest details, which helps a lot in production. It is also a traveling agent because it had movies automatically without having to be movies by a human hand. It is a smart camera with a very sharp lens. I got this result by searching "What kind of movie production devices have been invented recently" to help out with finding something else than a camera and microphone when I search for "movie production and hardware." From the promise I made last time of revising my searches, I made them more specific to what I needed to find on the internet, not to get some generic answer but one I could research further into.Â 

## Engineering Design Process
I am in the second step of the engineering design process where I conduct background research to understand the problem further by studying solutions or existing conditions.
