# Entry 2: What is the future of Movie Production?
##### 10/14/24

## Context
Since writing Blog 1, my focus has been on searching the web for software and hardware related to movie production. I wanted to look for more ways one could participate in the movie industry. Whether that be digitally or physically. The information I found researching software or apps that I could use to further indulge myself in knowledge or the actual production of quick films or edits. I looked for efficient and cheap ones that anyone could use to create their own short film. I needed software that works on Apple iOS devices, is easy to use on the go, and doesn't need to be set up somewhere. It had to have built-in transitions and sound contingencies to add sound effects and/or manipulate the voices of the actors staring in it. I found an app called WeVideo that satisfies all of these perks. I found WeVideo through changing my strategy for searching for something on the internet. Instead of imputing in the search bar "movie production" from last week, I have changed it to movie production apps" and have looked further into a website that ranked the weaknesses and strengths of movie production apps that are not commonly used. It described to me that it had tutorials in case anyone was confused about how to use it, and when I tried it myself, it was easy to understand and was great software. For my findings on hardware, I have found another article explaining inventions that changed the course of entertainment history. In this website called <a href="https://www.wrapbook.com/blog/new-film-technology">"10 Film Technologies Disrupting the Entertainment Industry" by Loring Weisenberger</a>, he talked about 3D printing, and in another called <a href="https://www.desktop-documentaries.com/video-production-equipment.html"> "Video Production Equipment" by Desktop Documentaries" </a> it talks about aerial landscape drones with high mic sensitivity, but I found one in particular that interested me. A new invention called "Moon Smart Focus." This device has incredible focus and can zoom into the tiniest details, which helps a lot in production. It is also a traveling agent because it had movies automatically without having to be movies by a human hand. It is a smart camera with a very sharp lens. I got this result by searching "What kind of movie production devices have been invented recently" to help out with finding something else than a camera and microphone when I search for "movie production and hardware." From the promise I made last time of revising my searches, I made them more specific to what I needed to find on the internet, not to get some generic answer but one I could research further into. 

## Engineering Design Process
I am in the second step of the engineering design process, where I conduct background research to understand the problem further by studying solutions or existing conditions. The creation of movies is not a simple task; it requires specific equipment, software apps, and actors to play the roles. The term movie production is less on-the-field activity but more of making a few clips seem like an actual movie. And what people don't seem to know is that technology played a big part in the invention of award-winning movies. It takes a lot of time to edit and portray a movie like how it's written or directed. Especially animated masterpieces take a few years to go through all the parts of editing and creating a movie. I am researching for the sole purpose of educating not only myself but also my peers about how technology plays a part in movie production in both the ways of software and hardware. For the next step in the EDP, I expect to imagine possible solutions to this problem and how I can spread the word and let it be clear to people who are not educated on the topic. I intend to explore possibilities for the project in the weeks to come to further extend my knowledge and piece it together to resonate and extend the explicable outcomes of how to fix this situation. 

## Skills
The skills I worked on last time were <b> "Prioritization, How to Google, and Time Management"</b>. Now I will update you on how the skills have developed since the last entry. 
#### Prioritization: 
Since the last time I have researched, like I said I would, and wrote this second blog before Monday, so I can continue with the next steps. Also, I meant it when I said I would prefer this class. I am applying to the new opportunity called PathFinders in the Slack channel that was just posted because I want to try and land an internship as soon as possible. I am also working on other projects from this class, but I am finishing this one first because it is due sooner. 

#### How to Google: 
In my research of late, I have taken my feedback and incorporated keywords into my research like "technology" and "innovation," which I have listed here last time. I also make sure the websites I'm looking at aren't sponsored, making sure they have the information I need. And if they don't, I dig deeper into the topic to increase my knowledge of problems and solutions. 

#### Time Management: 
I open up my weekends to do assignments like this one for big projects at the end of the year like the Freedom Project. I also practice code when I can on Free Code Camp so I can better finish my assignments and learn what I need to do to improve my writing. 

## Next steps

I am interested to explore and brainstorm solutions to the problem I'm researching. Which, I will probably do next week.
