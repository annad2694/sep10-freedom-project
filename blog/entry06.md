# Entry 2: Go beyond MVP
##### 5/12/25

### Content
Ever since the last Blog, the real coding has began for making our MVP and also improving it with each week until we present. Mr. Mueller previously had assigned us to pick a tool and research it. Using that tool we would put all of our work collectively by including what we did at the start of the yearr which was our Part A's (hardwares) and Part B's (softwares) into play to put together a website showing off our main topic. My topic is Movie Production and the tool I picked was Aframe.
