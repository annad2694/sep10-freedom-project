# Entry 2: Go beyond MVP
##### 5/12/25

## Content
<p>Ever since the last Blog, the real coding has begun for making our MVP and also improving it each week until we present. Mr. Mueller previously had assigned us to pick a tool and research it. Using that tool, we would put all of our work collectively by including what we did at the start of the year, which was our Part A's (hardwares) and Part B's (softwares), into play to put together a website showing off our main topic. My topic is Movie Production and the tool I picked was Aframe. Aframe is like a WebVR where you can code shapes, backgrounds, or photos to idealize a scene. And I felt like this was perfect for my topic, Movie Production. I made my MVP (Minimal Viable Product) using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. All of these things help build the website from scratch because I did not use a template. To do the basis of my website, Mr. Mueller suggested that we make a display for how we wanted our website to look like. For this, most of the class, including me, used a website called <a href="https://wireframe.cc/">wireframe</a>. Another component that made up how I made my MVP is <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components">Bootstrap</a>, Bootstrap is responsible for the responsiveness of my website, to keep the layout perfect on both desktop and mobile phones. These were the key things in helping develop my MVP in SEP class. </p>


### Challanges
<ol> 
  <li>I had many challenges along the way, but the biggest challenge was that I had not coded in a long time and I forgot how to make a website. From all the time that I used researching my tool, I had forgotten Bootstrap, how to put CSS into my IDE, and some HTML elements. And the worst thing was I had a great fear of asking for help. Mr. Mueller often encouraged me to use Slack and I do believe that to be a very helpful resource, but I was way too scared, so eventually I started to ask a few of my friends in my class some questions on how to make a working MVP. The point of an MVP is to have everything laid out on the website, but like it doesn't have to be functional yet. It has to have all of the context and everything you want laid out.</li> 
  <li>Once I started getting the hang of how to actually make the foundation of the website, it became easy. Although later on Mr. Mueller wanted us to improve our website by making it better. He wanted us to line up everything and make sure everything worked on mobile screens as well. This is when it got very difficult. I had missed most of the Bootstrap lessons and had to teach myself it in 2 days. One of my biggest struggles was making cards. At first I didn't realize they were a Bootstrap component until my friend Alex told me, but when I did I tried to make them work so bad but I just still couldn't get them to be responsive on mobile screens. I really wanted that to work so I could show it off, so I reached out to another friend of mine, Jehan, to whom I showed my code and she gave a suggestion on maybe how it could work. And after I added a little more to the suggested code it had finally worked. 
    <p>This is the code: </p>

  
  ```HTML
  <div class="container-fluid mt-4">
  <div class="row g-4">

 <div class="col-md-4">
      <div class="card">
  <img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/662b8a4944dbb4e0ccd51a28/677f9324fd7d513dda3755cb_66a791548d39ecf314840949_editing%2520on%2520capcut.png" class="card-img-top" alt="...">
  <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title">Beginner Level</h5>

```
  I realized that I needed a lot of classes and most importantly `container-fluid` that I did not have previously in my code. All I remembered is `col-md-4` and I didn’t know where to go from there. But eventually I really got the hang of Bootstrap elements and added an accordion inside my cards as well as a very functional navbar at the top of my website. </li> 
  <li>My last and final challenge was a small mistake in my Aframe. For the life of me I could not figure out how to link my Aframe to my website. Like the code was all there, but it just wouldn't show up like how I wanted it to. So I asked another one of my friends in that class, Zoya, who had the same tool as me. She told me that she had referred to another student's work and looked through his work to see what she was missing. I found it as a smart idea and looked through the same person's work and realized all my code was correct, I was just missing one line of code.


```html 
 <script src="https://aframe.io/releases/1.7.0/aframe.min.js"></script>

```
This line of code was the one line I needed to link my Aframe work onto my website. I realized later that you could find it if you went to the <a href="https://aframe.io/docs/1.7.0/introduction/installation.html">Aframe website--installation</a>, it will give you that line of code that you need to put in your head for all of your Aframe elements to work. </li>

### EDP
<p>I am currently in the last stages of my engineering design process because I am finished with my MVP. I have done my beyond MVP, which is tweaking it to look better. And I am ready for the last stage to work on feedback from my partners and present my final product. </p>

## Skill

<p>Two skills I'd say I am becoming proficient in is 
<ul> 
  <li> How to Learn</li> 
  <li> Communication</li> 
</ul> 
This is because in doing this project Mr. Mueller mostly wanted us to learn by ourselves so he enacted this thing called #LOYO which stands for learn on your own. So he left us alone for a week to learn all we can to make this possible. But in case we didn’t know he encouraged us to use communication to talk to our peers with anything that we are struggling with to learn from the feedback and as well become comfortable in asking for help which are two things that I used greatly. I communicated often outside of school, online through Instagram, and as well for "how to learn" I used tutorials online such as YouTube tutorials on how to perform some hard lines of code, especially for my Aframe that I wrote about in my last blog. </p>

## Takeways
<p>I would have written this earlier in the blog but I feel like it only makes sense if I state it now. As previously stated one of my main takeaways during this project is asking for help. Asking questions is one of my biggest benefits in this for I learned more the more I asked. It helped my MVP improve from a minimal viable product into a maximum valuable product. Overall I really enjoyed this project and I had a lot of fun with it, it was definitely worth it. </p>
