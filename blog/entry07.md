# Entry 2: Presentating Freedom Project
##### 6/5/25

### Content
<p>It is coming to the conclusion of the coding of a freedom projects, and the next step in class is to present what we have been working on. The first thing we worked on is making a slideshow that was quick and efficient to showcase what our website was about and how it was made. Mr. Mueller told us to make it short and sweet, and I feel like that could definitely be a takeaway because for the people who had paragraphs on their slides, it was really hard to maintain eye contact while reading off of that paragraph. Although when I did my in-class presentation, I think a good part of it was including screenshots of what I wanted to talk about and making a little mental note on the side of what I wanted to mention. But some of the takeaways that I grasped from Mr. Mueller's feedback is probably to make more eye contact with the audience, but also know that it was our first time presenting something like that, so it doesn't have to be perfect just as long as you tried.</p>

<p>Next step was to do the same thing and present, but now you're not only going to be presenting to your classmates — we have to present to judges and other students from other classes in our grade. For this we started out planning like what we were going to say, which is an explanation for something called an expo elevator pitch. This pitch had to be under a minute of you summing up what you did for your website, and you would get graded on that. I think a challenge that I really had during this was definitely keeping it a minute or less because I was always a few seconds ahead, but then I realized it was okay if I was because we wanted to keep it short, of course, for attention span, but if people were really intrigued in your project, they would listen. Although a takeaway would be not to make it so specific because these people didn't know what some of the elements and components were in our project, so I took more time explaining what those could be instead of assuming that they already knew. Maybe I wished I was less nervous, but overall I got a pretty good grade for the Expo elevator pitch and presented it well at the actual expo.</p>

<p>In my website I had done something a little different and already linked my code and possibly my slide presentation inside my nav bar, but here is a link to my presentation plan and my slides for this project.</p>

### EDP
<p>In my current stage of the engineering design process of the last and final one — to communicate the results — because the project was all done and all we have to do now is to show it off to other individuals. Possibly the next step of our engineering design process will continue on to next year when we reuse all of the steps with a new end-of-the-year project, and I'm looking forward to that.</p>

### Skills
<p>Since my last blog entry and having to present my project, I have definitely participated in the skill of <b>communication</b> for having to publicly speak to multiple groups about my project and then having to answer their questions based on my project. </p>
<p>And for the second skill I would maybe say <b>creativity</b> because I feel like I made it a very easy way to understand what I was saying by explaining the main concepts, which I don't think many people did, but as well as picking a very interesting and creative field of movie production for my website.</p>

<p> I have so much fun doing this project and can't wait for the next one.</p>
