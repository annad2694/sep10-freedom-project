# Tool Learning Log

## Tool: Aframe

3/16/25:
* From the previous Monday I had explored what Mr. Mueller taught me to do in class. He said I should go to the A-frame website and press on docs. I should copy it into my IDE first to see how it works and then tinker with it. That is what I did, I changed the positions, the colors, and observed what numbers made up the shapes. Then I thought about how to associate it with Movie Production, and I found a solution. Since I spent a long time researching hardware, I can build a #D model of a camera. Not the super techy ones I researched about, but to start off, I'd build a resemblance of one.
* Since tinkering of this week I have explored more of the page and eventually saw that they had a Slack and Github account to research more of their tool on. <a href="https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/tree/master/docs/components" target="_blank">Visit A-Frame Components Docs</a> I also watched part of the video of where this guy used the inspector tool to put geometic shapes ontop of each other. <a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYT97ZHPvEY>Youtube Inspection Tool</a>
* I think the biggest challange was to add the text ontop of the camera. iI just wanted to do it so people understand what it is because I know it's not the clearest 3D picture of one, but the more I tinker, the better I will get. I had trouble with getting it where I wanted to but I realized that I had to put "align" when I asked a friend. But I wasn't sure if it was going to work because "align" popped up as red which I thought was incorrect on my IDE but it turned out working fine. At first for planning I decided to split up a camera into different parts and comment it in my IDE so I wouldn't forget which parts I had to make out of those geometry shapes and I had to have a color wheel opened on tab to make surer I got the colors right. Maybe the only question I have is whether or not are these 3D models interactable and how do I approach that and add that to my FP. But thats really all I did for my thinking, I've learned so much and will improve my camera or make another hardware from my list next time.
