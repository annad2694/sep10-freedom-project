| Name | Glows | Grows |
| Jehan| I like the organization of cards in part A. | Change the background so that it is less vibrant and so the text is easier to read.|
|  Alexander |  The font and style you used is really nice and goes with the theme. | Fix your cards in part A, so they are readable to users and fix your arrow in aframe.

Planning my Presentation:
Hook
How will you introduce your project in a captivating way?

Think of your favorite movie or tv show. Does it have a lot of superheros in it? Is there a lot of gore? Is it a crazy action scene where there looks like  a million angles are being taken? This is all part of Movie Production, and unfortunately, most of it is not real. It is a concept behind the scenes.

Product
How will you show off what you made?

By providing a demo of what it is what I made to be shown off and tried as an example to others.

Process
How will you show us how you made it?

I will show you how I made it by going through the behind-the-scenes of the code and any challenges that I overcame while doing the project.

Conclusion
How will you summarize / wrap up your presentation?
