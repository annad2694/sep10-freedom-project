| Name | Glows | Grows |
| Jehan| I like the organization of cards in part A. | Change the background so that it is less vibrant and so the text is easier to read.|
|  Alexander |  The font and style you used is really nice and goes with the theme. | Fix your cards in part A, so they are readable to users and fix your arrow in aframe.
