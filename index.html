    Movie production has been around for over one hundred years and has been the foundation of entertainment for the world.
    There are many different fields that cover movie production like the editing portion, film producing, and the directors directing everyone behind the scenes.
    Technology is the creation of how we come to know of movies and shows today, and can still continue to progress them in a number of ways. There are hardwares and softwares that will improve the production of films that humans get to see.

            <p>These software and hardware provide prior knowledge to using it. For WeVideo, it is possible to work on it as a beginner but it is suggested that you need knowledge about the basics of video editing prior to working with the app. There are no tutorials implemented in the software but there is some explanation on how to begin using the app on Youtube if you donâ€™t already know. And 3D printing seems like something easy to do but it is hard. You must create and apply the design that you want to 3D print onto the printer and make sure the hardware is working properly so the design can be made. It is also important to have the right materials to print the design. Additionally, it is important to be aware of the limitations and capabilities of the printer. Finally, it is important to be patient and aware of any issues that may arise.</p>

            <p>These are the advanced things I found on the internet while searching for professional movie production software and hardware. The DJI Inspire 2 drone and the Moon Smart Focus are both things used out in the field when filming. They are used to get complex shots of the scene and make things cinematic. And After Effects is where those shots are imported and improved to fit perfectly and display itself like a movie. After Effects has a lot of settings and different ways to use it and would be very complicated for someone who is not trained in video editing. It would take 3 hours alone just to show someone all the controls that this limitless software uses.</p>

      <h3>Creation 1: An invention that allows you to smell movies</h3>
      <ul>




        <li> Have an on and off button. (incase something smells bad) (best on cooking shows)</li>
        <li>Can be used on any browser and on any app.</li>
        <li>Provide fumes through the screen that can be added on after the movie production.</li>
        <li>Software that enables the viewers to click smell on a movie software and have a fume or scent come off your device.</li>
        <li>Or have a hardware that is attached to the camera or mic held above actors that have an option to attach smells to the film so it can be more realistic to the viewer.</li>

    <div class="col-md-6">
        <h3>Creation 2: Interactive movies</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>If the person viewing the movie dislikes the ending of a movie or wants to change the decision of the actors they should be able to with a click of a button.</li>
        <li>From this they will be able to unlock a new secret ending each time and can replay the movie and choose different options each time.</li>
       Examples: Choose love, Black Mirror: Bandersnatch, and Cat Burglar.
  <a href="https://theticker.org/12058/arts/netflix-lets-viewers-choose-love-in-new-interactive-film/" style="color: red;">Experimentation pt. 2</a>    </ul>
I feel that after or as we produce the movie we should be able to ask the viewers for their overall opinion on what to add onto the interactive movies so that they can manipulate the movie to their liking and get a higher ranking score online with my new creations.

        <h3>My tool: Aframe</h3>
        <p class="my-tool">
     A-Frame can be employed to create a virtual replica of a movie set or stage so that directors and crew can visualize how things will appear prior to shooting.
They may visit the set virtually, play around with camera angles, and see how lighting affects the set, all through a web browser.
This makes planning scenes easier and reduces mistakes when actually producing them. It's a valuable previsualization aid, both time and budget-consuming. Like seen when you click, it shows a small display of a black ball and a directional light being shined on it. This light is coming from stage right, which is the left of the audience. This tool can also show different models of how advanced hardware or new inventions can look like. Aframe is really resourceful, and a lot of their information on how to use it or examples are already on the website.
